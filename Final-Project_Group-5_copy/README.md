# Final-Project_Group-5
Final-Project_Group-5 Main repository for UofM Data Visualization &amp;amp; Analytics Boot Camp Final Project (Group 5), hosted by Max Schweikl, Stephanie Leonard, Randy Sendek, Lucas Bratland and Bailey Van Ommeren

## Communication Plan/Alignment
Our team was very specific around our schedules of availability over the course of this project.  The goal is to complete most or all deliverable work within alloted class hours, with the additional option for the team to meet/discuss ad-hoc outside of classroom hours as needed.  Slack will servie as the primary and most crucial communication tool for all project work, including but not limited to link sharing, direct group messaging and formal huddle/Zoom meeting.  One critical component will be aligning to a role ownership each week.  While some team members have more comfortability/favorability of roles over others, we will still make sure each role has the support ownership needed to exceed, whether it's doubling up on some work or a team member owning a component role more than once if they're efficiently completing deliverables in that space.

## Project Topic
Our team all has an interest in various movie genres and love to watch both new films that are released as well as old films from prior years, and discuss our thoguths or opinions as to if we enjoyed the movie or not.  That being said, one area of curiousity is if one or more team member(s) likes a film, are they necessarilly in the majority or not with others on the same opinions or views?  What exactly classifies a film as "sucessful" or "unsuccessful?"  What are the various input components of a film, such as cast/crew, producer, genre, production budget, release date and so on, that have the most influence on a film's success or not?  The question our group is looking to answer will be that of classification, in that for past released films, what input factors corrolate the most with or drive the most success for a film, which we're defining as it's generated box office revenue producing at or more than double it's production budget.  From this, we can also hope to predict or infer on how successful future released films will be, based on prior trend of movies with similar production attributes.

## Dataset Chosen
At the moment, we will be utilizing a .csv dataset provided by the University of Minnesota that provides +$25M movie entries and a variety of different movie attributes, some of which were called out in the project topic headline above.  If this dataset is too large/overvalued, we will transition to an alternative option, which there are plenty of across Kaggle, most notably datasets accessed via IMDB.

## Tools to Clean Data
Python and Pandas will be utilized to clean our dataset throughout the length of this project.

## Chosen Database
Currently our group is leaning towards utilizing a SQL/PostGres database with the raw data contents being extracted as a .csv file.

## Chosen Machine Learning Model
Our team utilized a javascript enabled html page with plotly for our visualizations on this project, comparing various movie input components against their resulting revenue that was generated.  We would like to use a regression ML model to understand which movie production factors lead to the highest revenue success, as well as which attributes are either not correlated/connected as strongly.  Being this is a categorization question, it may also be worth exploring if a decision tree model also makes the most sense for our analyis here too.
